# Feedback Collection Application

![Alt text](images/feedback.png?raw=true "Feedback Collection System Design")


This is a simple feedback collection application implemented using ReactJS, Swagger, Spring Boot, MongoDB, MinIO, Fluentd and Docker. User can share their feedback through a provided web interface
and feedbacks are stored in the MongoDB repository. 

Fluentd and Dockerâ€™s native logging driver for Fluentd makes it easy to stream Docker logs from multiple running containers to the MinIO through fluent-plugin-s3. Generated application logs are streamed to Fluentd using Docker's log driver. Fluentd outputs the filtered input to MinIO bucket.

Further Swagger is used for documenting Backend APIs. Built-in Swagger UI makes user interaction with the Swagger-generated API documentation much easier.

## Run

- Clone the repository
- navigate to cloned feedback-collection-application folder from the terminal.
- execute ./feedback-collector/docker-based-build.sh to build feedback collector backend service
- execute command `docker-compose up`. You can access feedback-collector-ui from http://localhost:3000/
- You can access mongo-express from http://localhost:8081/ via a web browser.
- MinIO Browser can be accessed from http://localhost:9000/minio with AccessKey `minio` and SecretKey `minio123`
- Swagger Documentations can be accessed from http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui/.

## Logging

- To change the Server side log levels, alter the feedback-collector service configuration in docker-compose.yaml to desired level as follows.

```yaml 
    environment:
      - "FEEDBACK_APPLICATION_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG"
```

## Testing

- Navigate to feedback-collector and  Run `./gradlew test`
